Quick FTP

Usage:

QFTP <servername> <File>

Quick FTP is used to pass a file over the network without having to do all those FTP commands. The ideal behind it is that you will configure a QFTP.conf file which will have all your FTP information. Simple call QFTP via command line and provide the proper arguments and it will FTP the file over to the server. 

Quick FTP will also be designed to have muiltiple FTP servers saved. All the user has to do is called QFTP -c <FTPservername> and FTP will remember whihc FTP server is its default. QFTP will of course have a show default option which will be QFTP --ShowServer. This command will output the default server, IP, and username your using to login to the server.
